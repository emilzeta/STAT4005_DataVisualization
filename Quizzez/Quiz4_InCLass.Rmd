```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(maps)
alcohol_df <- read_csv(here("data/alcohol.csv"))

world_df <- ggplot2::map_data("world")
world_df <- world_df %>% rename("country" = region)
alcohol_full <- left_join(world_df, alcohol_df, by = "country")

ggplot(data = alcohol_full,
            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                          group = group,
                          fill = beer_servings)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black") +
 coord_map(projection = "gilbert",
           xlim = c(-180, 180)) + 
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_b()
```

### Question 2:

If we wanted to see if there's been a trend over time with alcohol consumption we might want to make a line graoh instead of a map.
